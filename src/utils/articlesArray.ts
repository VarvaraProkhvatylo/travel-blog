        description: "<p>Watching the sunrise at the Mount Bromo volcano in Indonesia is easily one of the most amazing travel experiences in the world. You can even climb the crater and look directly into the smoking volcano! </p> <p> Bromo can be visited on a road trip through East Java, along with other epic sights like the Ijen crater lake and giant waterfalls, or you can fly from Bali straight to Surabaya and visit Bromo on a day tour from there. </p> <p> We`ve done it both ways, and would love to go again. Either way, the Bromo volcano is a bucket list item you shouldn`t miss on your journey through Southeast Asia. </p> <p> This travel guide will explain how to go to Mount Bromo, what to see and do there, and everything else you need to know before you go! </p> <p> <h2> Where Is Bromo? </h2> </p> <p>  Mount Bromo is an active volcano crater located in East Java, Indonesia. </p> <p> It`s part of the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park, where you can see a cluster of 5 incredible volcanoes (including Bromo), and Java`s highest mountain Semeru puffing out smoke in the background. </p> <p>  Bromo is located between the cities of Malang, Surabaya, and Probolinggo, and you can visit it from any of those places. </p> <h2>  How To Visit Mount Bromo. </h2>  <p> The easiest way to visit Bromo is to fly to Malang or Surabaya, and then book a day tour or a multi-day trip from there. If you`re in Bali, you can also do it in the opposite direction, starting overland from Bali and then ending at Malang or Surabaya. </p> <p>  Bali has direct flights to and from Surabaya (SUB) every day, and a one way ticket can be as cheap as 700k Rupiah ($45 USD). You can shop for flights to Malang or Surabaya at Skyscanner. </p> <p> Once you arrive in Malang or Surabaya, it`s easy to book a day tour to Bromo or you can arrange everything yourself if you prefer. A full day tour is enough time to see all the highlights of the park. </p> <p> We normally like to do things without a tour, but this is one case where I think the tour is a good idea because it`s much more convenient and it includes extra activities like Jeep riding around the volcano. Bromo is a bucket list item and you want to do it justice. </p> <h2> Best Tour Package For Mount Bromo </h2> <p> Here`s a top rated day tour package for Mount Bromo starting from Surabaya or Malang. </p> <p> You can book this with Klook as a private tour or shared tour, and it includes all of the highlights like the Mount Bromo sunrise, jeep ride in the sea of sand, optional horse ride, crater hike at the volcano, and you can also add the Madakaripura waterfall as a bonus to the itinerary. </p> <p> If you`re wanting to do a multi-day trip, Klook has overland tours to Bromo and Ijen from Bali with guides, accommodation, and other expenses included. You can even add on a visit to the Tumpak Sewu waterfall. </p> <p> We`ve used Klook for lots of tours and activities around the world, and they`re great. Highly recommended! </p><h2>  Staying At Bromo </h2> <p> If you want to stay really close to the action, there are some hotels at Cemoro Lawang village right by Bromo, but they tend to be pretty basic and overpriced for what you get. </p> <p> Cemoro Lawang is generally not a fun place to stay because it`s very undeveloped and hasn`t caught up to the mass tourism at Bromo yet. That may change someday, but for now, most of the budget friendly hotel options at Cemoro Lawang are really rough. </p> <p> Our top recommendations there would be Cahyo Homestay Bromo, Good Karma Guesthouse, or Guesthouse Gunung Bromo. Again, don`t expect luxury. </p> You can see the highlights of the volcano in one full day tour, so it`s not really necessary to stay there longer unless you`re a serious photographer or just want more time exploring the area. <h2>  Best Things To Do At Mount Bromo </h2>  <ul> <li> <h3> Mount Bromo Sunrise </h3> </li> First things first — witness the famous sunrise at Mount Bromo! <p> Before you start exploring the mountain up close, you have to see the sunrise from the top of the caldera. Every tour package starts like this, and for good reason. </p> <p> It`s probably one of the best places in the world to watch the sunrise. The colors are amazing, and on a clear day you can see all the way to Mount Argopuro in the east. </p> <li> <h3> Mount Bromo Volcanoes Viewpoint </h3> </li> <p> The viewpoints on the north side of the caldera are where you can get those iconic pics of the volcano cluster. </p> <p>  Your main options are Seruni Point, King Kong Hill, Bukit Perahu, Bukit Cinta, or the highest viewpoint Penanjakan. You can click each of these links for map coordinates. </p> <li> <h3> Sea of Sand </h3> </li> <p> After sunrise, the next stop is the `sea of sand` at the bottom of the caldera. The locals call it Lautan Pasir, which means the same thing in Bahasa Indonesia. </p> <p> This is a really neat place and you`ll need to pass through it anyway to reach the Bromo crater. You can explore the sea of sand by Jeep, horse, or motorbike. </p> <p> It`s a perfect photo spot with the steep ridges of the Mount Widodaren volcano in the background. </p> </ul>",

        description: "<p> Planning your first trip abroad? In addition to all the excitement you're feeling, it's completely natural to feel a bit anxious. These international travel tips should help you feel prepared when it comes time to take your first long-haul flight: </p> <ul> <li> <h3> Arrive at the airport 3 hours early for an international flight.</h3> <p> (Even if your first flight is domestic, the overall trip still counts as international.) This may seem like overkill, but 3 hours is often necessary due to a lengthier check-in process, immigration checks, and increased security for international travel. Plus, international flights typically take place on larger planes, which means more travelers and longer lines.</p> <li> <h3>	Download e-books, movies, or shows prior to travel.</h3> Many international flights offer Wi-Fi, but it can be expensive. If you plan to read books or watch shows or movies on your smartphone or tablet during the flight, we recommend downloading them to your device ahead of time.</li>	<li><h3>Pack a portable charger.</h3> <p>It`s not always easy to find an available outlet in a crowded airport, and some planes don`t have charging ports.</p></li>	<li> <h3>Be sure you have a plan to get to your accommodations once you land.</h3> <p> You don't want to try to wing transportation on your first night in a foreign country.</p> </li> <li><h3>If your trip involves any train travel, remember that you'll be responsible for getting your luggage onto and off the train. </h3> <p>  Don't overpack. Choose a suitcase that is easily maneuverable like a rolling suitcase or a backpack. Dragging a bunch of duffel bags around, especially when experiencing jet lag, can get annoying quickly. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Register with the U.S. Department of State at the U.S. embassy nearest to your final destination through the STEP program. </h3> <p>  This can be a great resource for receiving alerts and allowing the embassy to contact you if you experience an emergency abroad. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Purchase travel insurance. </h3> <p>  Consider trip cancellation insurance to protect your trip investment if you trip is canceled or disrupted. Consider travel medical insurance if you want coverage for unexpected medical and travel-related expenses but don't need trip cancellation coverage. </p> </li> <li> <h3 >Try to conform to the local time as soon as possible. </h3> <p>  Getting some exercise and moving around outside once you land is a great way to start. Learn how to prevent and minimize jet lag. </p> </li> <li> <h3>Review the entry requirements for your destination country up to the date of your departure. </h3> <p> Even without COVID, these restrictions and requirements have been known to change from time to time. </p> </li>",

        description: "<p>While Rome and Tuscany remain destinations of choice for foodies, some may find the rampant tourism ever-so-slightly disheartening. Described by some as the `rising star` of Southern Italy, Puglia is a haven for those seeking excitement at a relaxed pace. The region`s food is also some of the best Italy has to offer. Craving a true Italian culinary experience? This guide will showcase the best of Puglia`s food, from signature dishes to landmark restaurants and hotels. </p> <p><h2>What can visitors to Puglia expect?</h2> </p> <p> Situated on the sun-soaked heel of Italy, Puglia has Italy`s longest coastline. Bordered by the Adriatic and Ionian sea, Puglia`s pristine beaches and crystal-clear waters are nothing short of delightful. </p> <p> Travel further inward and you will be met with acres of farmland. Thanks to Puglia`s sunny climate, as well as its rich and fertile soil, many of these farms have thrived for generations. It is for this reason that Puglia is commonly called the `garden of Italy`. With such perfect growing conditions, those in search of `farm to table` dining will be spoiled for choice in Puglia. </p> <p> Puglia is home to many picturesque towns steeped in ancient history. Although it is known as the `Tuscany of the South`, the town of Lecce has a beauty that transcends geographical borders. The town is known for its extravagant Baroque architecture, with a host of wine bars and quaint restaurants along its medieval streets. </p><p> Visitors to Southern Italy will have a hard time missing a strong Greek influence and Puglia is no exception. The region is home to sprawling vineyards and olive groves - Puglia produces 23% of Europe`s olive oil. Therefore, many meals will be served rather liberally with lashings of extra virgin olive oil! </p> <p> <h2> What are some common ingredients in Pugliese cooking? </h2> </p> <p> A historically poor region, meat has never been the centerpiece of local cuisine. Instead, visitors should expect hearty portions of vegetables - particularly zucchini, aubergine, and peppers. Of course, these fresh vegetables have been marinated, grilled and fried using local olive oil. Stuffed vegetables make frequent appearances in Puglia`s antipasti - with neighboring farms producing exquisite mozzarella and burrata cheese. One word of advice - those looking for small plates to graze on may find themselves having to share one portion of antipasti. </p> <p> Vegetables are not the only reward of Puglia`s fertile land. Made using local durum wheat, we`re not exaggerating when we say that Puglia`s bread is world-famous. The town of Altamura boasts one of the only loaves of bread in the world that have been granted Protection of Destination of Origin (PDO) status. This bread is baked in wooden ovens and made using a recipe that remains pretty much unchanged since the Middle Ages. Those who venture to the port city of Bari would do well to try its renowned focaccia. The traditional recipe calls for tomatoes, olives, and oregano. However, visitors are also likely to encounter focaccia stuffed with Provolone cheese and mortadella ham. </p> <p> When it comes to pasta, orecchiette is Puglia`s shape of choice. Deriving from the Italian term for `little ears`, nonnas have been carefully making orecchiette by hand on the streets of Bari since the 12th century. Made using durum wheat and water, the orecchiette is then left to dry out in the open air, before being bought by the kilo by keen locals and tourists alike. We also recommend trying some freshly-made cavatelli, small clam-shaped shells that effectively scoop up their accompanying sauce, which is more often than not a classic, rich tomato. </p> <p> <h2> What are some of Puglia`s signature dishes? </h2> </p> <p>Italians keep their pasta simple yet highly effective. When combined well, a mere handful of ingredients can make a bolder statement than the most eclectic pasta dish. A primary example of this is orecchiette con cima di rapa or `orecchiette with broccoli rabe`. The star of the dish is the sharp and pungent broccoli rabe, tempered with garlic, olive oil and a tasteful sprinkling of pecorino cheese. If you wish to fully adhere to the Pugliese tradition, you should pair this meal with an aromatic Primitivo or Aglianico wine. </p> <p> While we may have sparked an appetite for fresh Pugliese bread, we haven`t touched upon its accompaniments. Traditionally considered a peasant`s dish, fave e cicoria combines fava beans and chicory into a satisfying spread. Once again, we see a masterful balance of warm and bitter flavors, not to mention a nod to an Egyptian influence in classic Mediterranean cooking. While it may go without saying at this point, the final touch to fave e cicoria is a satisfying glug of olive oil. </p> <p> Historically speaking, while meat has never featured too heavily in Pugliese cuisine, meat dishes would traditionally be prepared in times of celebration. A standout example is braciole alla barese, tender rolls of meat stuffed with herbs, garlic, and cheese. These rolls are steeped in sugo della domenica - which translates to English as `Sunday sauce`. This is a slow-cooked meat and tomato sauce, usually served on Sundays and national holidays. </p> <p> Often you will find sugo della domenica served over two courses. First, the meat-infused tomato sauce is separated from the braciole. Then it is served over orecchiette, the fresh pasta soaking up the meat`s rugged flavors. The braciole will then be eaten as a secondo or main course. Those with a voracious appetite can also opt to have the two courses combined into a particularly rich and hearty dish. </p> <p> Although meat is easy to avoid in Puglia, this shouldn`t be taken as a comment on its quality. In Puglia`s marketplaces, butchers offer locally-reared lamb, beef and horsemeat. This can often be cooked fresh to order on an open wood-fired grill, known as a rosticceria. As the aromas waft along the market stalls, you`ll be forgiven for experiencing a sudden craving for succulent, tender lamb. </p> <p> <h2> How can visitors to Puglia gain an authentic culinary experience? </h2> </p> <p> Those on the lookout for sophisticated `fine` dining won`t encounter many options in Puglia. Instead, visitors should expect hearty, rustic meals and traditional flavors. One guaranteed way to have authentic culinary experience is to book a stay in a masseria. </p> <p> Masserie are farmhouses and country houses that have been renovated for tourists. Those interested in masserias can opt for a charming bed and breakfast, or even a five-star hotel. Many of the masserie lie at the heart of working farms. A typical lunchtime offers freshly-pressed olive oil, herb-infused burrata cheeses and vegetables picked straight from the garden. The masserie are also a delight architecturally-speaking - within the white stucco walls, you`ll find influences from Spanish, Greek and Moorish design. </p> <p> Those seeking both authenticity and luxury should make a play for the Masseria Trapana. This 16th-century farmhouse has been restored into a plush hotel, ten minutes away from the sparkling Adriatic coast. Nestled within hectares of olive groves, orange and lemon trees, the Masseria Trapana has all the mainstays of a tranquil getaway, from yoga classes and games to a sizable swimming pool. </p> <p> We also strongly advise staying in a masseria if you`re a keen wine-drinker. In fact, Puglia is the second-largest wine-producing region in Italy. In Crispiano, just an hour`s drive from Bari International Airport lies the Masseria Amastuola Wine Resort. Situated amongst acres of olive trees and vineyards, this ancient manor has been renovated with a modern, minimal eye. The wine is flowing all year round, be it from the vineyard or the cellar. Masseria Amastuola specializes in rich and full-bodied reds. Their organic Primitivo has garnered over 17 national and international awards. However, those wishing to book a stay must do so in the Summer months as the winery`s accommodation is closed between November and March. </p> <p> In July, Puglia has been known to reach temperatures of up to 100°F. Visitors and residents alike flock to beachside restaurants, bars, and delis. There, you can expect simple and satisfying dishes, prepared using freshly-caught seafood. We recommend Porto Ghiacciolo. This intimate oasis is nestled in a coastal corner a stone`s throw away from Monopoli. Spend a languid afternoon in tranquil waters then venture up to one of the local restaurants, where you`ll be served sauteed mussels and ice-cold beer. One word of advice - Porto Ghiacciolo is not the best-kept secret, so you may want to arrive relatively early! </p> <p> When it comes to dining in Puglia, the focus is on time-honored ingredients and techniques. There isn`t that demand for `contemporary takes` on local cuisine, which can at times feel fussy and artificial. Instead, chefs and restaurateurs offer no-frills dishes that have barely changed since when their grandparents were cooking them. A great example of this is Le Zie Trattoria in Lecce. This restaurant serves rustic meals that showcase Puglia`s local produce. The ambiance is permeated with a familial warmth (the restaurant is rather aptly known by locals as La Zia or `The Aunt`.) It`s no wonder that visitors liken it to their nonna`s kitchen. Our favorite dish is the ciceri e tria - combining earthy chickpeas with fried pasta for a compelling mix of flavors and textures. </p>",

        description: "<p> The famous Patagonia region of Argentina has some amazing hiking trails, but the very best would have to be the day hike to Mount Fitz Roy and the Laguna De Los Tres! </p> <p> This entire trek is full of great scenery, and at the end you get to see a spectacular blue glacier lake called Laguna De Los Tres, which sits at the foot of Mount Fitz Roy, one of the most impressive and iconic peaks in South America. </p> <p> The Fitz Roy hike is a challenge, with plenty of distance and elevation gain, but most hikers will still find it very doable. And even if you don`t go all the way to the lakes, you can still get amazing pictures of the mountains from the Fitz Roy Mirador (viewpoint) after only a moderate amount of hiking from the town of El Chalten. </p> <p> This travel guide will explain how to do the Laguna De Los Tres hike, what to bring, best time to visit, how to get to El Chalten, and everything else you need to know before you go! </p> <p> <h3> Fitz Roy Quick Facts: </h3> <ul> <li> Distance: 22 kilometers (14 miles) return </li>	<li> Elevation Gain: 1,050 meters (3,445 feet) </li> <li> Ending Elevation: 1,175 meters (3,850 feet) </li> <li> Duration: 7 - 9 hours return </li> <li> Difficulty: Moderate / Hard </li> </ul> <p> These stats are for the full hike to the lake of Laguna De Los Tres from El Chalten.

        description: "<p> Whenever you are considering a trip to a new place, it's always a good idea to do research before you leave home. With that in mind, you are on the hunt for some good travel tips for Europe, and you know that there is a lot of learning ahead of you before you can travel with some idea of what you are doing. We thought we would lend a hand by compiling our own list of easy travel tips for Europe that might help make your European tour more enjoyable and just a little easier to manage. </p> <ul> <li> <h3> Tip #1 </h3> <h3> Pack as Light as Possible </h3> <p> There is a good chance you will be carrying or pulling your luggage more often than you think. Lots of travel sites recommend that you pack so light that you only need a 20-pound carry-on bag. This form of traveling is known as backpacking. While it is ideal for some, we recognize it isn't for everyone. If you need to pack more than a backpack, make sure your suitcase has wheels. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Tip #2 </h3> <h3> Purchase Passes Ahead of Time </h3> <p> Most of the major cities in Europe have passes that will get you into several attractions. Purchasing these passes save you money, and you can even buy them before you leave home. It is also a great idea to purchase your transportation passes in advance so you can hit the road as soon as you land overseas. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Tip #3 </h3> <h3> Keep an Open Mind </h3> <p> Your friends (or favorite travel blogs) might have tons of advice when it comes to what to see and what to skip, but you shouldn`t let that completely determine your itinerary. Make sure you see the things you want to see and do the things you want to do. After all, it is your trip and not theirs. Make a detailed list of sights you want to see, and try to build your vacation around the most important destinations on your list. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Tip #4 </h3> <h3> Make a Budget </h3> <p> If you set a maximum spending amount before you actually leave for your trip, you will be far less likely to spend too much. Make sure you plan on buying food, and spending money on entertainment and souvenirs. Also, be realistic with how much money you can afford to part with. Research the cities you are visiting so you know how much things cost. </p> </li> </ul> ",

        description: "<p> Himeji Castle, also known as Himeji-jo, is the biggest medieval Samurai castle in Japan, and arguably one of the coolest and most photogenic places in the entire country. </p> <p> The design and history here are incredible and very worth a visit even from other parts of Japan. Himeji Castle can be visited easily on a day trip from nearby places like Kobe, Osaka, or Kyoto. </p> <p> I grew up loving Samurai everything, so naturally this castle was on my Japan `bucket list` for years. We`ve done the day trip to Himeji Castle from Osaka several times now, and it`s always fascinating. </p> <p> This travel guide will explain how to get to Himeji Castle, and what to expect when you visit! </p> <p> <h2> History Of Himeji Castle </h2> </p> <p> Himeji-jo started construction in the 1300s, and then it was expanded even more in the 1600s by Samurai ruler Toyotomi Hideyoshi. </p> <p> At one time, thousands of soldiers lived in the Himeji-jo complex, and many times throughout history the castle was almost lost. During World War II, Allied bombs were dropped on the castle and failed to explode. It also survived a major earthquake in the 1990s. </p> <p> Today, Himeji-jo is listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site and also a National Treasure of Japan, and it gets about 3 million visitors per year. The castle recently went through 5 years of restoration work and it`s finally viewable again without tons of scaffolding on the main keep, so right now is a GREAT time to go see it. </p> <p> <h2> Visiting Himeji Castle: What To Expect </h2> </p> <p> Himeji is a huge fortress complex that covers almost 240 hectares (600 acres), stands about 60 meters (200 feet) tall, and has dozens of defensive gates, moats, and walls from the medieval period in Japan. </p> <p> I would budget at least a couple of hours for walking around the castle complex and seeing everything here, although we personally explored the castle grounds for almost 4 hours and could have stayed longer. </p> <p> I`ve wanted to see Himeji Castle ever since I was a kid, so when I was passing through Japan recently I knew I had to devote an entire day to the experience. </p> <p> The castle is such a work of art, especially when you view it at a distance. </p> <p> The castle complex is HUGE and there are a lot of different areas to explore; it`s easy to get lost in, but that`s part of the fun. </p> <p> The main keep has 6 stories and you can climb to the very top and look out through the bow-and-arrow slits for a better view of the surrounding city. </p> <p> There are some great restaurants and gift shops near the castle that are worth checking out as well. </p> <p> <h3> Entrance Fees </h3> <ul> <li>	Adults: ¥1000 ($7 USD) </li> <li> Kids: ¥300 </li> </ul> </p> <h3> Visiting Hours </h3> <ul> <li> Normal Hours: 9 AM - 5 PM </li> <li> Summer Hours: 9 AM - 6 PM </li> The last allowed entry time is 1 hour before closing </ul> <p> The castle is generally open every day of the year except for December 28 and 29. Tickets can`t be reserved in advance. </p>",

        description: "<p> Is it safe to travel alone as a woman? The answer is yes—as long as you take the proper safety precautions. A little experience and a lot of planning can go a long way, but if you`re traveling alone for the first time, you may still be a bit nervous. Just like many other solo activities, it's normal to feel a little anxious until you find your footing. </p> <p> While there is no best age to solo travel, inexperienced travelers will want to pay close attention to these helpful solo female travel tips: </p> <p> <ul> <li> <h3>	Plan ahead. </h3> <p> Having a flexible travel itinerary can bring many joyful surprises, but having at least your first night thoroughly planned out can start your trip off on the right foot. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Research the area you`re visiting beforehand. </h3> <p> Use websites like Trip Advisor to learn about popular scams within your destination country, areas to avoid, and how the healthcare system works for travelers. Also research appropriate clothing for women to ensure you adhere to your destination`s culture. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Consider purchasing travel medical insurance if you`re traveling abroad. </h3> <p> Travel medical insurance is designed to help cover expenses resulting from unexpected travel mishaps and emergencies, such as a travel delay or interruption or a sudden illness or injury. Some countries and visas require insurance. </p> <p> Additionally, many primary health insurance plans provide limited or no coverage outside of the traveler`s home country, so obtaining travel medical insurance can be an important step in the travel planning process. Learn more about why you may need travel medical insurance. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Let others know where you are going. </h3> <p> Be sure to check in with friends or family back home and share your travel details, such as accommodations, side trips, and train and flight bookings. Establish a plan regarding how often they should expect to hear from you. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Play it safe. </h3> <p> Don't feel like you need to answer every question asked of you by the people you meet; being vague is more than acceptable when locals and fellow travelers ask about where you're staying or your specific plans for the day. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Trust your instincts. </h3> <p> If something doesn't feel right, don't hesitate to change your plans. And remember—never risk your safety due to a fear of being seen as impolite. </p> </li> <li> <h3> Don`t flaunt your valuables. </h3> <p> Leave expensive jewelry and other valuables at home to reduce the risk of becoming a target for a pickpocket. </p> </li> <li> <h3>	Stay aware of your surroundings. </h3> <p> Avoid wearing headphones while exploring new cities and stay alert and aware at all times. Avoid drinking too much, as this could impair your judgment and put you in danger. </p> </li> </ul>",

        description: "<p> With high-quality ingredients, deep-rooted food traditions, and a passion for gastronomy, the Spanish know how to do food. For this reason, travelers understand that any trip to Spain is not complete without a crash course into this culinary wonderland. </p> <p> But, where do you start? </p> <p>  With distinct eating times, food customs, and lingo, a first-time visitor can easily be overwhelmed. Read on- we`ll break down a day in the life of Spanish food from `tapa` to bottom so you can navigate Spain`s mealtimes with ease and confidence, and eat like a local in Spain. </p> <p> The legacy of Spain`s food scene has been brewing for hundreds of years. With its influential position on the Iberian Peninsula, Spain has played home to the Romans, Visigoths, and even the Moors. All bring different religions and customs. Later on, the country`s role in the “discovery” of the Americas further transformed the cuisine. Spain became one of the first places to be influenced by New World cooking practices before it migrated throughout the rest of the continent. </p> <p> Larger than California but smaller than Texas, Spain`s diverse culinary scene is packed into a relatively small country. Here, cities just a few hours apart might be known for entirely different foods. This makes culinary travel across Spain rewarding and plentiful. </p> <p> Like a scavenger hunt for foodies, the Spanish celebrate the highest quality local ingredients, and they will travel specifically just to have them. If paella is what you want, make sure to visit Valencia, where this well-known dish defines the region. On the other hand, if you find yourself in Burgos, you must try the morcilla. (Yes, it`s technically blood sausage but don`t worry about that.) In Galicia, `pulpo a la gallega` (Galician octopus) it is! </p> <p> As you can see, Spanish food is an extensive study on the importance of local ingredients and the influence of different cultures. So if you want to eat like a local in Spain, just make sure to stick to a few rules: eat regionally, look for the highest quality ingredients, and do as the Spaniards do. Sounds simple right? Here`s everything else you need to know. </p> <p> <h2> How to eat like a local in Spain: Timing is Everything </h2> </p> <p> In most cities around the United States, there is no need to stick to a specific schedule to ensure high-quality and tasty meals. Most restaurants are open for the entire day, giving you the ability to grab breakfast at 7 a.m. or 10 a.m., and dinner at 5 p.m. or 8 p.m., whatever you prefer on that given day. </p> <p> This isn`t the case in Spain. </p> <p> Here, most restaurants (especially the best ones) are closed between meals and only open for the hours during that meal service. Did you decide to take a nap during the middle of the day? Good luck finding a place to take you in for a late lunch. Starving, and it`s only 6 p.m.? Hold tight; there are still a few more hours until dinner service! </p> <p> Paying attention and sticking to mealtimes and opening hours of restaurants will not only save you from getting `hangry`, but it will also give you a better chance of eating at the best spots. Any restaurant in Spain that will serve you a meal outside of what`s typically acceptable is most likely made for tourists anyway. </p> <p> <h2> But first, coffee. </h2> </p> <p> The Spanish aren`t the earliest risers, given their typically late bedtime, so don`t be surprised if you can`t find yourself a hearty plate of carbs and protein at 7 a.m. Instead, many Spaniards will opt for a coffee and a light bite (usually toast or a pastry) at home for their first meal. </p> <p> The most common way to have coffee in Spain is a `cafe con leche,` meaning `coffee with milk.` Typically made with espresso and equal parts hot milk, this coffee is both not too strong and not too filling, perfect to accompany some quick toast on your way out the door. </p> <p> <h2>  Second breakfast is the best breakfast. </h2> </p> <p> Around mid-morning, many Spaniards emerge from both their homes and places of work to head out to a local cafe to grab a larger bite to eat (and another coffee). Since lunch is still hours away, this is the perfect time to try some of Spain`s simplest but most delectable combinations. </p> <p> Order a `pan con tomate` or toasted bread served with olive oil and smashed tomatoes, for one of the most popular. Top your bread with spoonfuls of the tomato, slather it in olive oil, and top with salt. This simple Spanish food is both filling, satisfying and quick. `Tortilla española` is another popular staple. Composed of potatoes, egg, and onion (sometimes!), this potato omelet is perfectly simple. Since everyone has a slightly different method for making it, try it at a few different places to see which way you like it best. With onion and somewhat runny on the inside is our favorite. Alternatively, go big and order some `churros con chocolate. These fried pieces of dough are then dipped into semi-dark liquid chocolate, almost as thick as molasses, before being devoured immediately. </p>",
