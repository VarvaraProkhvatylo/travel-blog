        description: "Planning your first trip abroad? In addition to all the excitement you're feeling, it's completely natural to feel a bit anxious. These international travel tips should help you feel prepared when it comes time to take your first long-haul flight:         •	Arrive at the airport 3 hours early for an international flight. (Even if your first flight is domestic, the overall trip still counts as international.) This may seem like overkill, but 3 hours is often necessary due to a lengthier check-in process, immigration checks, and increased security for international travel. Plus, international flights typically take place on larger planes, which means more travelers and longer lines. •	Download e-books, movies, or shows prior to travel. Many international flights offer Wi-Fi, but it can be expensive. If you plan to read books or watch shows or movies on your smartphone or tablet during the flight, we recommend downloading them to your device ahead of time.•	Pack a portable charger. It's not always easy to find an available outlet in a crowded airport, and some planes don't have charging ports.•	Be sure you have a plan to get to your accommodations once you land. You don't want to try to wing transportation on your first night in a foreign country.•	If your trip involves any train travel, remember that you'll be responsible for getting your luggage onto and off the train. Don't overpack. Choose a suitcase that is easily maneuverable like a rolling suitcase or a backpack. Dragging a bunch of duffel bags around, especially when experiencing jet lag, can get annoying quickly.•	Register with the U.S. Department of State at the U.S. embassy nearest to your final destination through the STEP program. This can be a great resource for receiving alerts and allowing the embassy to contact you if you experience an emergency abroad.•	Purchase travel insurance. Consider trip cancellation insurance to protect your trip investment if you trip is canceled or disrupted. Consider travel medical insurance if you want coverage for unexpected medical and travel-related expenses but don't need trip cancellation coverage.•	Try to conform to the local time as soon as possible. Getting some exercise and moving around outside once you land is a great way to start. Learn how to prevent and minimize jet lag.•	Review the entry requirements for your destination country up to the date of your departure. Even without COVID, these restrictions and requirements have been known to change from time to time.",
